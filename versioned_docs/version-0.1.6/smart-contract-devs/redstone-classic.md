# ðŸ’¹ Classic Model - pushing feeds on chain


Although the on-demand fetching model is more efficient and scalable we acknoledge that 
some protocols may prefer to stick to a traditional design when data is pushed on-chain. 
This setup could be resonable if: 
- There is existing well-audited codebase and the team prefers not to make even tiny ammendments 
- The protocol is deployed on private network or a chain where the gas costs are minimal
- The prices don't need to be updated too frequently

:::info
Even though RedStone oracles can be adapted to a push model, our modular design still gives
you much advantage by having the decisive voice on when and how the price is updated.

## How it works

The model consists of two main parts. The first one is the off-chain [relayer](#relayer) responsible for pushing data on-chain in a customized way using [environment variables](#environment-variables). The second part are the on-chain [contracts](#contracts) which enable storing prices and getting them through a familiar interface (e.g. the [Chainlink Aggregotor] (https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol) ).

### Relayer

The relayer is a service which works in a customizable way based on [environment variables](#environment-variables). It periodically checks a defined set of conditions, pushing the prices when they are satisfied. It is possible to pass multiple conditions to the `UPDATE_CONDITIONS`, then relayer will work in the manner that if any conditions are met prices would be updated. Currently, two conditions are implemented:

- `time` condition described by `UPDATE_PRICE_INTERVAL` variable in milliseconds, which states how often prices should be updated (aka heartbeat), [code](./src/core/update-conditions/time-condition.ts)

- `value-deviation` condition described by `MIN_DEVIATION_PERCENTAGE` variable which indicates how much value should change in order to trigger the price update, [code](./src/core/update-conditions/value-deviation-condition.ts)

### Contracts

The on-chain relayer is based on is the [PriceFeedsAdapter contract](./contracts/price-feeds/PriceFeedsAdapter.sol) which is responsible for:

- storing all price feeds symbols (mappings to RedStone dataFeedId),
- storing price feeds values,
- updating price feeds values in batch,
- storing information regarding the round number and timestamp of the last update,
- getting prices for multiple feeds values in a single call.

Additionally, if the protocol wants to be 100% compatible with the Chainlink PriceFeed architecture, it's possible to deploy additional [PriceFeed](./contracts/price-feeds/PriceFeed.sol) contracts to mimic this solution.
